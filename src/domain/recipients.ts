 * A directory of the offices a local request can reasonably go to.
 *
 * Most people know what they want changed and have no idea who decides it — a crosswalk is Public
 * Works, not the mayor; a school crossing guard may be the district rather than the city. Sending a
 * request to the wrong office is the most common way a real petition dies quietly.
 *
 * Every office below is FICTIONAL, invented for this demo. The point is the shape of the
 * information — level of government, what the office actually controls, how long it usually takes —
 * not the specific bodies. A real deployment would load its own jurisdiction's directory here, and
 * `responseDays` would have to come from that jurisdiction's published service standards rather
 * than from an app's guess.
